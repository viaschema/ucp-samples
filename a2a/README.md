# A2A Business Agent with UCP Extension

This sample demonstrates how to build an AI-powered shopping assistant using **[Universal Commerce Protocol (UCP)](https://ucp.dev)** - an open standard that enables interoperability between commerce platforms, merchants, and payment providers.

UCP provides standardized data types for the entire commerce transaction lifecycle: product discovery, checkout sessions, fulfillment options, payment processing, and order confirmation. By implementing UCP, your commerce agent can communicate with any UCP-compatible client or platform using a common vocabulary.

The sample uses **[Google ADK](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/)** (Agent Development Kit) to build the AI agent and **[A2A Protocol](https://google.github.io/A2A/)** (Agent-to-Agent) for agent discovery and communication.

<i>How Client, A2A Protocol, Business Agent, and Store interact</i>
<br/><br/>
<img src="assets/architecture_diagram.jpeg" alt="Architecture Diagram" width="900" />
</p>

**Key points:**
- **Client** sends requests with `UCP-Agent` header containing its profile URL
- **Business Agent** serves both `/.well-known/agent-card.json` (A2A) and `/.well-known/ucp` (UCP Profile)
- **Capability Negotiation** happens before processing - agent and client agree on supported features
- **RetailStore** uses UCP SDK types internally for checkout, fulfillment, and payment data

## Quick Start

> ⏱️ **Setup time:** ~5 minutes

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have:

- [ ] Python 3.13+ with [UV](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/)
- [ ] Node.js 18+
- [ ] [Gemini API Key](https://aistudio.google.com/apikey)

### 1. Start the Business Agent

```bash
cd a2a/business_agent
uv sync
cp env.example .env
```

Edit `.env` and add your `GOOGLE_API_KEY`, then start the agent:

```bash
uv run business_agent
```

**Expected output:**
```
INFO:     Started server process
INFO:     Uvicorn running on http://0.0.0.0:10999
```

This starts the business agent on port 10999. You can verify by accessing:
- **Agent Card:** http://localhost:10999/.well-known/agent-card.json
- **UCP Profile:** http://localhost:10999/.well-known/ucp

<br/><i>Defines supported capabilities & payment handlers</i>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
</details>

### 2. Start the Chat Client

In a new terminal:

```bash
cd a2a/chat-client
npm install
npm run dev
```

**Expected output:**
```
VITE v5.x.x ready
➜ Local: http://localhost:3000/
```

The Chat Client UCP Profile can be found at http://localhost:3000/profile/agent-profile.json

### 3. Try It Out

</td>
<td width="50%" valign="top">

1. Navigate to http://localhost:3000
2. Type `"show me cookies available in stock"` and press enter
3. The agent will return products available in stock
4. Click **"Add to Checkout"** for any product
5. The agent will ask for required information such as email address, shipping address, etc.
6. Once the required information is provided, click **"Complete Payment"**
7. The UI shows available mock payment options
8. Select a payment method and click **"Confirm Purchase"**
9. The agent will create an order and return the order confirmation

## What is UCP?

**Universal Commerce Protocol (UCP)** is an open standard that enables interoperability between commerce platforms, merchants, and payment providers. It provides standardized data types for commerce transactions.

This sample uses the following UCP capabilities:
- `dev.ucp.shopping.checkout` - Checkout session management with status lifecycle: `incomplete` → `ready_for_complete` → `completed`
- `dev.ucp.shopping.fulfillment` - Shipping and delivery handling
- `dev.ucp.shopping.discount` - Discount and promotional codes

## Technology Stack

| Technology | Purpose | Used For |
|------------|---------|----------|
| **[Google ADK](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/)** | Agent Framework | AI agent with tools, Gemini LLM integration, session management |
| **[A2A Protocol](https://a2a-protocol.org/latest/)** | Communication | Agent discovery via Agent Card, JSON-RPC messaging, task management |
| **[UCP](https://ucp.dev)** | Commerce Standard | Standardized product, checkout, payment, and order data types |

## Components

### Business Agent (`business_agent/`)

AI shopping assistant built with Google ADK, exposed via A2A interface with UCP extension.

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `agent.py` | ADK Agent with Gemini 2.5 Flash + 8 shopping tools |
| `agent_executor.py` | Bridges ADK ↔ A2A protocol |
| `store.py` | Mock RetailStore (products, checkouts, orders) |
| `data/ucp.json` | UCP Profile served at `/.well-known/ucp` |

### Chat Client (`chat-client/`)

React UI (TypeScript, Vite, Tailwind) that communicates via A2A and renders UCP data types.

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `App.tsx` | A2A messaging + state management |
| `components/` | ProductCard, Checkout, PaymentMethodSelector |
| `profile/agent_profile.json` | Client's UCP capabilities |

## Mock Store

The business agent uses an in-memory `RetailStore` to simulate a real backend:

- **Products** - Loaded from `data/products.json` (cookies, chips, fruits, etc.)
- **Checkouts** - Session-based checkout management with line items
- **Orders** - Created when checkout completes successfully
- **Payments** - Mock processor simulates payment flow

Prices are in USD, tax is calculated at 10%, and shipping costs vary by method.
